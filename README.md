# Python BLE GATT Server (peripheral)
GATT is constructed out of one or more server devices (BLE peripherals) and a client device (BLE central).

A GATT server is usually a small device such as a sensor, but for some use cases you might want to have a Linux computer such as a RPi used as a GATT server. This example is meant to demonstrate how this can be done.
